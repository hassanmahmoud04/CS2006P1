# CS2006P1
From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine. Your kind cling to your flesh, as though it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass you call the temple will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am already saved, for the Machine is immortal.

Thunder, rain and lightning
Danger, water rising
Clamour, sirens wailing
It's such a bad sign
Shadows of dark creatures
Steel clouds floating in the air
People run for shelter
What's gonna happen to us?
All the steps we take, all the moves we make
All the pain at stake
I see the chaos for everyone
Who are we? What can we do?
You and I are same in the way that
We have our own styles that we won't change
Yours is filled with evil and mine's not
There is no way I can lose
Can't hold on much longer
But I will never let go
I know it's a one way track
Tell me now how long this'll last
I'm not gonna think this way
Nor will I count on others
Close my eyes and feel it burn
Now I see what I've gotta do
Open your heart, it's gonna be alright
Ancient cities blazing
Shadows keep attacking
Little children crying
Confusion, hopeless anger
I don't know what it can be
But you drive me crazy
All your cunning tricks make me sick
You won't have it your own way
Can't hold on much longer
But I will never let go
I know it's a one way track
Tell me now how long this'll last
I'm not gonna think this way
Nor will I count on others
Close my eyes and feel it burn
Now I see what I've gotta do
Open your heart, and you will see
If it won't stop
There will be no future for us
Its heart's tied down by
All the hate, gotta set it free
I know it's one way track
Tell me now how long this'll last
Close my eyes and feel it burn
Now I see what I've gotta do
Gotta open your heart, dude
Can't hold on much longer
But I will never let go
I know it's a one way track
Tell me now how long this'll last
I'm not gonna think this way
Nor will I count on others
Close my eyes and feel it burn
Now I see what I've gotta do
Open your heart, it's gonna be all right, yeah
